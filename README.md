# POC project to test the usage of a remote shared ui lib

I've published a styled components on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pauloluan/shared-ui) to check if this is gonna work or not on a single spa config.

It works on vite, but didn't on single-spa...

The sources of the Shared-ui lib is available [here](https://github.com/PauloLuan/shared-ui)
